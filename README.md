# Notes about contributions

Hello Developers! This is currently the homepage.
Ideas that you contribute will be added to this (if approved). When the changes are
approved and work, the website will be exported to GitHub.

**What we need coded:**

- Cosmetic updates to any page.
- General page improvements.
- Fixing issues
- Anything that would make the website better in your opinion.

**PLEASE ONLY USE STATIC CODE: This includes:**

- Pure HTML
- Pure CSS
  - CSS Libraries
- JavaScript (This does not include Node.js)
  - JavaScript Libraries (This does not include NPM packages)

We need to do this because our hosting
provider only supports static sites. If you would like to use a backend
language, we may be able to host it on Glitch and make it a subdomain.
Please talk to us if you plan to do that!

**How to submit your code:**

Option One (the best way): Fork this repo and submit a pull request

Option Two (the ok way): Upload code on our <a href="https://developers.scriptingtosavelives.com/code/">website.</a>
